# Palindrome Evaluator

This project is a simple Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. It was created to practice string processing and core Java programming concepts.

## Project Files

1. PalindromeEvaluator.java  
   Contains the logic that checks if a string is the same forward and backward.

2. Main.java  
   Runs the program and lets you test words or phrases to see if they are palindromes.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.  
3. Run the compiled program from a terminal or command prompt.

## What This Project Includes

1. A Java implementation that evaluates whether text is a palindrome  
2. Simple user input and output  
3. Practice with loops and string handling

## About the Concept

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward when ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter case.

## Purpose

This project was built to strengthen skills with Java and with processing text. It was part of coursework at Bay Valley Tech Code Academy.
